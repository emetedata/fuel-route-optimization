# fuel-route-optimization
This project determines optimal refueling stops and amounts along a route, aiming to minimize fuel cost or travel time. Results use fuel price and route data, with interactive maps showing optimal strategies and trade-offs between cost and efficiency.

This repository only contains the final HTML version of the project.
The full Jupyter notebook cannot be published because it requires a personal API key to access external fuel-price and routing services (OpenRouteService and the Spanish Ministry of Energy API). Executing the notebook without proper rate-limits could also break the API usage quotas.

The HTML file includes all methodology, code, visualizations, maps, and optimization results, making the full project fully viewable without execution.This repository only contains the final HTML version of the project.
